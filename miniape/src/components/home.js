  Dr Enny was searching for the wonders of life and a new experiment to embark on. One day, his intuitive and destructive urges would compel him to venture into a dangerous experiment that would soon reveal secrets of a strange and uncanny dimension.</p>

<p>Dr Enny had constructed a portal that led to a strange place, a world which he had no knowledge about but still tried to explore from the comfort of his lab. To find out more about this mysterious portal, Dr Enny grabbed one of his test subjects from his bunker: A helpless, average ape. He threw the ape in the portal and to his surprise‚Ä¶ The ape came back out of the portal but something strange had happened. The ape was doused in strange clothing and had changed mannerism and size. He did it again and again and again, each monkey more bizarre and unique than the last. Getting carried away with his experiment, 
Dr Enny had become so fixated by his evolved creation that he did not notice the army of apes he had created. On test subject 3,333, the apes rallied to overtake Dr Enny then fled using the portal back to the strange dimension‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The apes renamed their new found land ‚ÄúSolana Island‚Äù, now free from the clutches of the man that experimented on them, these apes seek to create a new prospering and aspiring land that would help their race excel and grow.
